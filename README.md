TaskTracker -- A plugin that turns WordPress into a SIMPLE task tracking system.
====================================

## DESCRIPTION
## INSTALLATION
## THEMING
Theming should be done as followed:
1. Simple customization -- Override CSS in your THEME!
2. Advanced customization -- Override the template by creating a template in your current theme file.

## REPO STRUCTURE
### LIBRARY
### THEME
At the root level you'll find templates that should reflect the WordPress template naming convention as much as possible. 
For more information check the WordPress docs [here] (http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy). Note the plugin will try
and load the template for the current theme first then will fall back on the "default". i.e.
  /wp-content/theme/[my-theme]/task-single.php
  /wp-content/plugins/task-tracker/theme/task-single.php
